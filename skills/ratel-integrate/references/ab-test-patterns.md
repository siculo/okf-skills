# A/B test patterns for a Ratel rollout

Three strategies. Pick one per pilot; document the pick + the customer's flag/split mechanism in the plan. Whatever the strategy, every trace must land in Langfuse with a `feature_flag` tag valued either `tool_pool=full` (control) or `tool_pool=ratel` (treatment) — that tag is what the dashboards in [`ratel-langfuse-integrate/references/langfuse-value-map.md`](../../ratel-langfuse-integrate/references/langfuse-value-map.md) split on.

## Pattern 1 — Live feature flag (preferred default)

When to use:
- Traffic is enough to learn from a split (rule of thumb: ≥200 traces / day on the pilot trace_name).
- The customer has a feature-flag layer or is willing to add one.
- Production risk of the Ratel arm is acceptable (i.e., even if it underperforms, no user is broken).

How it works:

1. At each request entry point, read the flag for the current user/session. Two values: `full` (control) and `ratel` (treatment).
2. The flag decision is made *once* per trace and propagated as the `feature_flag` trace tag.
3. The control arm runs the agent with the customer's original tool list.
4. The treatment arm runs the agent with Ratel's top-K (Mode 1) or via the gateway (Mode 2).
5. Both arms emit traces; dashboards split on the tag.

What to specify in the plan:

- The flag name (`ratel_tool_pool` or per the customer's convention).
- The decision rule (50/50 hash on user_id; 10% ramp; cohort-based).
- The propagation site (the file + line that sets the trace tag).
- The kill switch (how to force everyone to `full` if the treatment arm misbehaves).

Common pitfalls:

- **Re-deciding per turn**: if the flag is re-read mid-session, a user can flip arms across consecutive turns and the analysis becomes noisy. Pin the decision at session start.
- **Flag missing from trace tag**: every dashboard's split filter relies on `tag.feature_flag` being present on every trace. If the flag is only logged in metadata, the dashboards won't pivot correctly.
- **Tag includes the user_id**: don't. Tags are coarse, low-cardinality.

## Pattern 2 — Shadow mode

When to use:
- Production risk is high (regulated industry, top-tier customer, brand-sensitive output).
- The customer wants validation before any user sees a Ratel-influenced response.
- Cost of running both paths in parallel is acceptable.

How it works:

1. The production path runs unchanged and is what the user sees.
2. In parallel, the Ratel path runs with the same input. Its output is written to Langfuse but discarded; the user never sees it.
3. Both runs produce traces. Tag the shadow trace `feature_flag=tool_pool=ratel` and `tag.shadow=true`; tag production `tool_pool=full`.

What to specify in the plan:

- Where the shadow invocation forks (the entry point or a queue consumer).
- The cost cap (% of production traffic to shadow — default 10%).
- How shadow output is silently logged (Langfuse, not user-facing logs).

Common pitfalls:

- **Shadow leaks to user**: any path where the shadow run's output is returned to the user breaks the experiment. Add a test that asserts shadow responses are never returned.
- **Doubled side-effects**: if any tool has a side effect (writes a row, sends a message), the shadow run will double-execute it. Stub side-effecting tools in shadow mode or skip them.
- **Latency**: shadow doubles compute cost and sometimes wall-clock latency (if the dispatch isn't async). Decouple via a queue if it matters.

## Pattern 3 — Replay

When to use:
- Live traffic is too thin for a meaningful split (<50 traces / day on the pilot trace_name).
- The customer has an eval dataset or is willing to record inputs from production for offline replay.
- A one-shot delta is enough (rather than ongoing measurement).

How it works:

1. Collect a sample of real inputs into a Langfuse dataset (or any storage). Tag them as the baseline.
2. Replay each input through the agent under the Ratel arm offline. Log replay traces with `feature_flag=tool_pool=ratel` and `tag.replay=true`.
3. Compare baseline traces (tagged `tool_pool=full`) and replay traces side by side.

What to specify in the plan:

- The dataset name and how it's collected.
- The replay harness (a small script in the customer's repo or an internal eval tool).
- The eval criteria (cost delta, score delta against ground truth if labelling exists).

Common pitfalls:

- **Inputs leak production data**: the dataset will contain real user inputs. Treat it as production data — same access controls.
- **Time skew**: replay runs against the current state of the world (current prompts, current model snapshot, current tools), not the world the baseline saw. Note this caveat in the plan; if any of those change between baseline collection and replay, the comparison is contaminated.
- **No ground truth, no signal**: if there's no scoring mechanism (programmatic, LLM-as-judge, or human), the replay only gives you cost/latency. That's still useful, but say so.

## How to ask the user when the pattern isn't obvious

Codebases without an existing flag layer are common. Don't invent a new one without asking. Ask in one batched question:

> A/B strategy is the part of this rollout that's most codebase-specific. Quick check:
>
> - Do you already use a feature-flag tool (LaunchDarkly, Statsig, GrowthBook, Unleash, or something internal)?
> - If not, would a simple `process.env.RATEL_ARM_PCT` + hash-on-`user_id` split be acceptable for the pilot, or do you want me to recommend a third-party tool?
> - Is shadow mode an option, or is the per-request compute budget too tight?
> - Any traffic-level constraints I should know about (e.g., paid tier only, geo restrictions, internal employees only)?

Wait for the answers before writing the A/B section of the plan. Putting a placeholder "TBD" in the plan is worse than asking.

## Trace tagging cheat-sheet

Regardless of pattern, every Ratel-arm trace needs these tags / metadata for the dashboards to work:

| Field | Value (treatment arm) | Value (control arm) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag.feature_flag` | `tool_pool=ratel` | `tool_pool=full` |
| `tag.env` | `prod` / `staging` / `dev` (same in both) | same |
| `tag.stack` | the customer's stack id (same in both) | same |
| `tag.agent_version` | git sha or version (same in both) | same |
| `metadata.gateway_origin` (on Ratel observations) | `direct` or `agent` | n/a |
| `metadata.top_k` (on `ratel.search_capabilities`) | the k used | n/a |
| `metadata.replace_mode` | `true` (Mode 1 replace) or `false` (gateway mode) | n/a |
| `tag.shadow` (Pattern 2 only) | `true` on shadow traces | not present on prod traces |
| `tag.replay` (Pattern 3 only) | `true` on replay traces | not present on baseline traces |

These exact field names are what the dashboards filter on. If the customer's instrumentation uses different names, change them everywhere — including the dashboards plan — not just here.

## Success criteria (write these into the plan)

For the pilot to be called successful:

- **Token Cost & Savings dashboard** shows ≥30% drop in input tokens on the treatment arm vs control for the pilot trace_name. (Rule of thumb; tune to the customer's expectations.)
- **Retrieval Quality dashboard** shows recall@5 ≥0.7 over the window (if ground truth is wired) or top-hit-score distribution clearly skewed to high values.
- **Error rate** on the treatment arm is within 1pp of the control arm (no regression).
- **p95 latency** on the treatment arm is within +50ms of the control arm (Ratel itself adds <1ms; anything bigger is a wiring bug).

State these explicitly in the plan, so "did the pilot succeed?" has a one-line answer two weeks in.
